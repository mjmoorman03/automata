# Cellular Automaton Shape Generator

This project explores the fascinating world of cellular automata, inspired by a talk given by **Stephen Wolfram at Harvard**. It provides a simple way to generate and examine the shapes produced by automata using Python.

## How to Use

1. **Modify the Rules**: Open `generator.py` and locate the dictionary named `rules`. Update its values to define your own automaton behavior.
2. **Run the Driver Script**: Execute `driver.py` to observe the shapes generated by the automaton.

```bash
python driver.py
```

## Requirements

This project requires Python 3. Ensure you have any necessary dependencies installed before running the script, as found in requirements.txt.

## Inspiration

The idea behind this project comes from the automata presented by Stephen Wolfram at a talk at Harvard that I attended, whose research in computational systems has demonstrated the complexity and beauty that simple rule-based systems can generate.

## License

Feel free to modify and experiment with the code! Contributions and suggestions are welcome.
